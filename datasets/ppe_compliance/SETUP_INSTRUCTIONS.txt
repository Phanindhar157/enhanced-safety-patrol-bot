    PASCAL VOC 2012 DATASET SETUP INSTRUCTIONS:
    
    IMPORTANT: PASCAL VOC 2012 has a specific structure that needs to be processed!
    
    Dataset Structure:
    pascal_voc_2012/
    ├── JPEGImages/          # All images (.jpg)
    ├── Annotations/         # XML annotation files
    ├── ImageSets/Main/      # Train/val/test splits
    └── SegmentationClass/   # Segmentation masks
    
    AUTOMATIC PROCESSING (RECOMMENDED):
    1. Download PASCAL VOC 2012 from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gopalbhattrai/pascal-voc-2012-dataset
    2. Extract the dataset to a folder (e.g., "pascal_voc_2012")
    3. Run: python datasets/process_pascal_voc.py
    4. Follow the prompts to specify paths
    
    MANUAL PROCESSING (Alternative):
    1. Extract PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset
    2. Use the person annotations to identify person images
    3. Manually categorize images for PPE compliance:
       - Person images with helmets → datasets/ppe_compliance/helmet/
       - Person images without helmets → datasets/ppe_compliance/no_helmet/
       - Person images with glasses → datasets/ppe_compliance/glasses/
       - Person images without glasses → datasets/ppe_compliance/no_glasses/
       - Person images with safety vests → datasets/ppe_compliance/vest/
       - Person images without safety vests → datasets/ppe_compliance/no_vest/
       - All person images → datasets/ppe_compliance/person/
    
    For Object Detection:
    - Vehicle images → datasets/object_detection/vehicles/
    - Equipment images → datasets/object_detection/equipment/
    - Person images → datasets/object_detection/people/
    - Animal images → datasets/object_detection/animals/
    - Obstacle images → datasets/object_detection/obstacles/
    
    NOTE: PPE detection from PASCAL VOC is limited. For better results, 
    consider using specialized safety equipment datasets or manual annotation.
